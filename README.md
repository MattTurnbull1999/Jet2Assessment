# Jet2Assessment

This is my First Application for a Junior Dev role! I think the overall assesment was tougher that it seemed! I think in terms of CSS and HTML i am highly Skilled
However in Javascript i am still learning, but make no mistake my Javascript skills are getting better everyday and i beleive its only a matter of time until i 
secure a junior development role! I belive my personality would make me an ideal fit for any business, i belive i am a people person and can adapt to any working
environment, if you would like to hear more from me i think it would be great if we set up a meeting!

In terms of the assessment, i wanted to make it close to how a customer would generate a modal, by filling out a holiday form and actually booking (i know its a fake 
holiday) a holiday. Being completly honest, i havent practiced the modal concept prior to this assessment, so it gave me a chance to research the topic and how other 
developers use this. Using it was hard, as i was unfarmiliar with the modal type i had to reearch it, find out how to generate it and edit it so it made sense for a 
user. I used sites such as bootstrap, youtube and ws3 school to help. I also used google fonts and font awesome to style the assessment.

Whatever happens from here, it has been a great chance to learn and grow as a coder, i have left a message in the why hire me section aswell, it would be much 
appreciated if you could take a look and if you have time, i would love to hear some feed back!
